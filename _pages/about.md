## Background

**QuestCrunch** is an educational mobile application aimed towards helping teachers aid their students in developing self-study habits outside of school and tuition. QuestCrunch serves as a platform for teachers to schedule regular timed study sessions for their students to complete school assignments/revision in groups with their peers. It has a gamification element, where with each successful study-session without exiting the application, will be rewarded with virtual coins that can be exchanged with real life rewards provided by their teachers. 

## The Problem

Students in secondary school and junior college often face difficulties in finding the discipline and motivation to do their homework and revision independently. Students also may face difficulties with procrastination, and in trying to focus, due to the distractions offered by their smartphones. Oftentimes, this results in students attempting to complete their work and revision at the last minute. Over time, this may turn into a bad habit that results in students facing a lot of stress.

## Why QuestCrunch?

There are existing applications out there that attempt to help develop focus, such as _StudyBunny, Forest_ and _Pomodoro_, with gamification elements and reward systems that help to encourage focus. 

**Pain Points**

However, the rewards provided by the application are virtual, and each timed session is scheduled up to the studentâ€™s discretion. Students may find it hard to get motivated by intangible rewards, and allowing students to schedule each timed session in their own time at their own target does not prove effective if students tend to procrastinate their study time in the first place. 

**Solution**

In QuestCrunch, the timed study sessions in the application are scheduled by a teacher, and students are rewarded with virtual coins, which may be exchanged with real-life rewards decided by their teachers. In this way, QuestCrunch provides a platform that helps to facilitate and encourage study habits in students, paced by their teachers.
