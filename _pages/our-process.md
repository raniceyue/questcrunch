## User Study Plan

## Design Process

**Ideation Stage**  
The team came together to brainstorm different possible user interfaces using the Crazy 8's method exercise practiced in lecture

### Prototype 1st Iteration
For this 1st iteration, each member came up with 1 prototype each based on our own design ideas, and the list of functions we had came up with for QuestCrunch.

### Prototype 2nd Iteration
For the 2nd iteration, we decided to pick the 2 best prototypes from the 4 prototypes in the 1st iteration

**Prototype A (Elizabeth's Prototype)**  
Prototype A by Elizabeth is a minimalist take on the application, with a soothing colour palette and simplified icons. We felt that its simple UI could be appealing to teachers, which is one of our major target audiences.

    image_path="/images/A_3 grabs.png" 
    caption="Prototype A" 
%}

**Prototype B (Beatrice's Prototype)**  
Prototype B by Beatrice is a gamified take on the application, with a bold colour palette and pixel art that grabs attention. We felt that this eye-catching UI could be appealing to students, which is our other major target audience.

    image_path="/images/B_3 grabs.png" 
    caption="Prototype B" 
%}

Using these 2 prototypes, we conducted our expert evaluation on our peers to guage the usability, pros and cons of each respective prototype.

### Prototype 3rd Iteration
For the 3rd iteration, after gathering feedback from our expert evaluation, we decided to combine the good aspects of each respective prototype into 1 semi-final prototype.

In coming up with this 3rd iteration of the prototype, we carefully considered _Neilson's Heuristics_ in the design of each page. 

| Heuristic          | Feature in Prototype |
|--------------------|----------------------|
|1. Visibility of system status |  a. When user does an action, they will receive a notification pop up to indicate completeness of the action taken <br> b. Teachers are informed of the the number of available rewards in the rewards tab |
|2. Match between system and the real world | a. Icons that were used mirrors similar events in the real world: eg: to represent the calendar view, we had a calendar icon. A House icon to represent the home page. These icons are very much understandable and user were able to navigate through the prototype well. <br> b. Teachers are informed of the availability status of rewards through the 3-colour traffic colour theme (green, yellow, red) to represent available, runnings low or unavailable respectively |
|3. User control and freedom | Users are allowed to go back when they are on secondary pages (not the landing page for respective menu tab icons) |
|4. Consistency and standards | Buttons, fonts and font size were standardized throughout the final prototype |
|5. Error Prevention | We included respective warning messages for ‘dangerous’ acts such as deleting rewards and forfeiting quests |
|6. Recognition over recall | |
|7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use ||
|8. Aesthetic and minimalistic Design||
|9. Help users recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors ||
|10. Help and Documentation||

Using this 3rd prototype, we conducted another evaluation with our target users, Teachers and Students.
